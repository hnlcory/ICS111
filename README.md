Goals of this Course and Learning Objectives

ICS 111 Introduction to Computer Science I (4)
Overview of the fundamentals of computer science emphasizing problem solving, algorithm development, implementation, and debugging/testing using an object-oriented programming language. Pre: Recommended: computer experience.

Student Learning Objectives for the Fall 2020 ICS 111 are:

Use an appropriate programming environment to design, code, compile, run and debug computer programs.
Understand basic programming concepts such as program flow and syntax of a high-level general-purpose language.
Demonstrate working with primitive data types, strings and arrays.
Learn basics of programming with a modern programming language, in our case Java:
Variables
Expressions
Looping
Branching/Conditionals
Exceptions
Methods (Subroutines/Functions)
Classes, Interfaces and Inheritance
Graphical User Interfaces
Understand how to install and use a good Java development environment.
Demonstrate basic problem-solving skills relevant to computer science: analyzing problems, modeling a problem as a system of objects, creating algorithms, and implementing models and algorithms in an object-oriented computer language (Java).
