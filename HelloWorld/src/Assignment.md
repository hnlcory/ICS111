Instructions
Use the Assignments tool in Laulima to submit all assignments.  This assignment must be submitted before 12noon HST on Friday, September 4th, 2020.

For every problem in every assignment, turn in a file called yourUsername, followed by the assignment number, followed by the problem number.  For an example using the instructor's username of esb, for this assignment the instructor would turn in esb1a.txt, esb1b.java, and esb1c.java.  In each case, you must replace "esb" with your own UH username.

For each program, you must include an initial Java comment (beginning with "//") listing your name and the lab section.  For example, the instructor would start programs B and C below with

// Edoardo Biagioni, lab section 0

For every program, you should also include comments that might be useful to the TA to understand how your program works, and also any comments that you need to remind yourself how your program works.

For programming problems, you get full credit if your program compiles and runs correctly, and follows all instructions for naming and comments.  If your program is substantially complete and compiles correctly, you will get a score of at least 50% or more for that problem, even if at runtime the program is not completely correct.

A. Install Java on a device you have access to, recording which version of Java you have installed.  Then install Eclipse (or other IDE, but Eclipse is strongly recommended and is the only one supported in the labs).  The Eclipse IDE is available at http://www.eclipse.org.  Instructions for installing are available at the course web page, http://www2.hawaii.edu/~esb/2020fall.ics111/index.html

Turn in a text file (youUsername1a.txt) reporting which version of Java and which IDE you installed.  Also include any questions or comments for the TA.

B. Write a program to print "Hello, world!".  Compile and run this program, and verify that it prints out "Hello, world!".  The Eclipse tutorial that you can choose to run after installation makes this particularly easy.

Turn in a Java file (youUsername1b.java) with the code of your hello world program.

C. Modify the program to print "Hello, your name!", where your name is a placeholder for your actual name.  Compile and run this program, verifying that it prints "Hello, your name!".

Turn in a Java file (youUsername1c.java) with the code of this program.
